# Time Series Data Visualization and Analysis Techniques

## About the Project
This repository contains my work on the **Time Series Data Visualization and Analysis Techniques** project, completed as part of a Coursera Guided Project. The project focuses on analyzing global and regional temperature trends using time series data and various visualization techniques in Python.

## Key Topics Covered
- Introduction to Time Series Data
- Data Preprocessing
- Analyzing Global Temperature Trends (1995-2019)
- Comparing Yearly Average Temperature Across Regions
- Analyzing Monthly Average Temperature in Canada

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- **Notebook Environment:** Jupyter Notebook/Google Colab

## Recommended Experience
- Good knowledge of Python programming
- Familiarity with the Plotly library
- Experience working with Jupyter Notebook
- Basic understanding of data visualization

## Project Files
- `time_series_analysis.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook containing the full analysis
- `dataset.csv` – Dataset used for the project
- `README.md` – Project documentation

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/coursera-time-series.git
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
3. Follow the steps outlined in the notebook to explore and analyze time series data.
